# Tokens

To put simply, **JWT (JSON Web Token)** is a way of representing claims which are name-value pairs into a JSON object. JWT [spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) defines a set of standard claims to be used or transferred between two parties.

On the other hand, **JWS (JSON Web Signature)** is a mechanism for transferring JWT payload between two parties with guarantee for Integrity.
